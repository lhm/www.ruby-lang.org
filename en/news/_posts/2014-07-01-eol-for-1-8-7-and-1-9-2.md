Extended maintenance of Ruby versions 1.8.7 and 1.9.2 will discontinue July 31, 2014

## Further information

These versions were extended to support Heroku customers on the bamboo stack. With the end of life for [Herokuâ€™s Bamboo stack](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/cedar-migration), we no longer plan to maintain these Ruby versions.

We recommend you upgrade to a **stable version** of Ruby immediately, so that you can continue to receive bug and security updates.

For any parties concerned with continuing maintenance of Ruby `1.8.7` or `1.9.2`, please contact us at hone@ruby-lang.org and zzak@ruby-lang.org.
